For this to be easy to use, I recommend installing `npm` and `npx` on your system.

1. Install Node from here: https://nodejs.org/en/ (Pick whatever LTS version there is. Currently it's 16.X.X)
2. Open your command prompt.
3. Run `npm i -g npx`. 
4. If you get an error, try running the same command:
    - Windows: Open the command prompr in Admin mode.
    - MacOS / Linux: `sudo npm i -g npx` and enter your profile password.
5. Restart your system just to be sure.
6. Go to the folder where you extracted the code. Run `npx serve .` or start the `start.bat`. 
7. Visit `localhost:3000`
8. Voila.
